# My linux dot files

This is the repository about my dot files config on linux as backup, moving distro or safety net.

Note that these are for normal configs for other distro than NixOS where i will store dotfiles in HomeManager.

Mostly i am not a heavy ricer as much and usually i always like using a wm (windows manager) than a de (desktop env).
Also if using wayland most of them already a compositor (no need to have server like X11 server to use X11 app).

## Features

Currently using

- cmus : terminal music player
- fastfetch : show of machine type
- fuzzel : search for program
- kitty : terminal emulator that implement kitty display image protocal also tab
- mako : nofication daemon
- niri : scrolling windows manager and also a compositor for wayland
- neovim : best text editor and semi ide (sorry vscodium but electron app)
- starship : customize bash PS1 and PS2 output more eyes candy
- swaybg : wayland display background image
- swayidle : idle daemon to active other programs
