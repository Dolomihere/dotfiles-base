# My linux dot files

This is the repository about my dot files config on linux as backup, moving distro or safety net.

Note that these are for normal configs for other distro than NixOS where i will store dotfiles in HomeManager.

Also remember to change any software keybind in the config if you want to use mine as a base (i should be easy for you to see since /run/current-system/* place around).

## Features

Mostly i am not a heavy ricer as much and usually i always like using a wm (windows manager) than a de (desktop env).

Currently using

- broot : a terminal file manager
- cmus : terminal music player
- fastfetch : show of machine type
- fuzzel : search for program
- kitty : terminal emulator
- mako : nofication daemon
- niri : scrolling windows manager and also a compositor for wayland
- starship : customize bash PS1 and PS2 output more eyes candy
- sway : wayland windows manager like i3
- swaybg : wayland display background image
- swayidle : idle daemon to active other programs
- swaylock : lock screen with wallpaper
- waybar : status bar on wayland like polybar

Have used

- alacritty : terminal emulator that is simple
- btop : show your computer status on cpu, ram, ... improment from htop
- conky : display text on screen 
- i3 : windows manager for X11
- neofetch : old before fastfetch
- polybar : status bar for X11
